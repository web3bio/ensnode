# ENSRainbow

ENSRainbow is an ENSNode sidecar service for healing ENS labels. It provides a simple API endpoint to heal ENS labelhashes back to their original labels.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Node.js v18 or later (for local development) — see monorepo package.json for engines spec

## System Requirements

### Data Ingestion Requirements (`ingest` command)
- **Storage**:
  - At least 15 GB of free disk space:
    - 6.37 GB for the compressed rainbow tables download
    - ~7 GB for the LevelDB database after ingestion
    - Additional temporary space during build/ingestion
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB RAM recommended

### API Server Requirements (`serve` command)
- **Storage**: 7.61 GB for the Docker image (pre-built with LevelDB database)
- **Memory**: Minimum 1 GB RAM (4 GB recommended for optimal performance)
- **CPU**: Minimal requirements - operates well with low CPU resources

You can find our pre-built Docker image at [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/namehash/ensnode/pkgs/container/ensnode%2Fensrainbow).

## Architecture Overview

For backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph, the current rainbow tables (6.37 GB) are exactly the same as those published by [The Graph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/ens-rainbow) which are [MIT licensed](https://bucket.ensrainbow.io/THE_GRAPH_LICENSE.txt).

- **Storage Layer**: Uses LevelDB as an embedded key-value store to efficiently map labelhashes to their original labels
- **API Layer**: Exposes a REST API endpoint that accepts labelhashes and returns the corresponding original label
- **Data Ingestion**: Processes a pre-computed rainbow table (SQL dump) to populate the LevelDB store
- **Performance**: Provides fast, constant-time lookups for known ENS labels through LevelDB's efficient indexing

The service is designed to be run as a sidecar alongside ENSNode, helping to "heal" the labelhashes of unknown labels by finding their original labels when available.

### Current Release & Future Direction

The initial release of ENSRainbow focuses on backwards compatibility with the ENS Subgraph, providing the same label healing capabilities that ENS ecosystem tools rely on today. However, we're actively working on significant enhancements that will expand ENSRainbow's healing capabilities far beyond what's currently possible with the ENS Subgraph. These upcoming features will allow ENSRainbow to heal many previously unknown labels, making it an even more powerful tool for ENS data analysis and integration.

## Getting the Rainbow Tables

Our copies of the original ENS rainbow tables (6.37 GB) are stored in a public bucket. To download them:

1. Download the original ENS rainbow tables and verify checksum:

```bash
# Download files
wget https://bucket.ensrainbow.io/ens_names.sql.gz
wget https://bucket.ensrainbow.io/ens_names.sql.gz.sha256sum

# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c ens_names.sql.gz.sha256sum
```

## Quick Start with Docker

1. Build the Docker image (includes data download & ingestion):

```bash
# while in the monorepo root directory
docker build -t ensnode/ensrainbow -f apps/ensrainbow/Dockerfile .
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3223:3223 ensnode/ensrainbow
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:3223`.

## NameHash Labs Hosted Instance

NameHash Labs operates a freely available instance of ENSRainbow for the ENS community at https://api.ensrainbow.io. This service:

- Is provided free of charge with no API key required
- Has no rate limiting
- Is maintained and monitored by the NameHash Labs team
- Runs the latest version of ENSRainbow

> **Important**: While we provide a freely available hosted instance for the ENS community, we strongly recommend running your own ENSRainbow instance alongside ENSNode in your infrastructure. Co-locating these services on the same local network significantly improves indexing performance.

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

```bash
curl https://api.ensrainbow.io/health
```

Response: `{"status":"ok"}`

### Heal Label

```bash
curl https://api.ensrainbow.io/v1/heal/0x[labelhash]
```

The `labelhash` parameter must be strictly formatted as a "normalized labelhash" according to these requirements:
- Must start with '0x'
- Must be exactly 66 characters long (including '0x' prefix)
- Must be lowercase
- Must be a valid hex string that converts to exactly 32 bytes

For example, this is a valid "normalized labelhash":
```
0xaf2caa1c2ca1d027f1ac823b529d0a67cd144264b2789fa2ea4d63a67c7103cc
```

These would be invalid:
```
# Too short
0xaf2c
# Not lowercase
0xAF2CAA1C2CA1D027F1AC823B529D0A67CD144264B2789FA2EA4D63A67C7103CC
# Missing 0x prefix
af2caa1c2ca1d027f1ac823b529d0a67cd144264b2789fa2ea4d63a67c7103cc
```

Examples:

1. Successful request:
```bash
curl https://api.ensrainbow.io/v1/heal/0xaf2caa1c2ca1d027f1ac823b529d0a67cd144264b2789fa2ea4d63a67c7103cc
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "label": "vitalik"
}
```

2. Invalid labelhash format:
```bash
curl https://api.ensrainbow.io/v1/heal/0xinvalid
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Invalid labelhash - must be a valid hex string",
  "errorCode": 400
}
```

3. Label not found:
```bash
curl https://api.ensrainbow.io/v1/heal/0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Label not found",
  "errorCode": 404
}
```

Note on returned labels: The service returns labels exactly as they appear in the source data. This means:

- Labels may or may not be ENS-normalized
- Labels can contain any valid string, including dots, null bytes, or be empty
- Clients should handle all possible string values appropriately

Error Responses:

- `400 Bad Request`: When the labelhash parameter is missing or invalid
  ```json
  {
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Invalid labelhash - must be a valid hex string",
    "errorCode": 400
  }
  ```

- `404 Not Found`: When no label is found for the given labelhash
  ```json
  {
    "status": "error",
    "error": "Label not found",
    "errorCode": 404
  }
  ```

### Get Count of Healable Labels

```bash
curl https://api.ensrainbow.io/v1/labels/count
```

Success Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "count": 133856894,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-30T11:18:56Z"
}
```

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run data ingestion (requires ens_names.sql.gz) and verify the number of unique label-labelhash pairs in the database:

```bash
pnpm run ingest
```

3. Start the service:

```bash
pnpm run serve
```

You can verify the service is running by checking the health endpoint or retrieving the label count:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3223/health

# Get count of healable labels
curl http://localhost:3223/v1/labels/count
```

Expected count as of January 30, 2024: 133,856,894 unique label-labelhash pairs

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure different aspects of the service:

### Global Variables
These variables affect all commands:
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level, one of: "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace", "silent" (default: "info"). Case-insensitive.
- `NODE_ENV`: Standard Node.js environment variable used to indicate the current environment, such as "development, "test", or "production". If "production" a performance optimized logging format is used.

### Server Command Variables
These variables affect the ENSRainbow server operation:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3223)


## Service Management

### Graceful Shutdown

The service handles graceful shutdown on SIGTERM and SIGINT signals (e.g., when receiving Ctrl+C or Docker stop commands). During shutdown:

1. The HTTP server stops accepting new connections
2. The database is properly closed to prevent data corruption
3. The process exits with appropriate status code (0 for success, 1 for errors)

## Command Line Interface

ENSRainbow provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing the service. You can view detailed help for any command by adding `--help` after the command:

```bash
pnpm ingest --help     # Show help for the ingest command
pnpm validate --help   # Show help for the validate command
pnpm serve --help      # Show help for the serve command
```

### Key Commands

#### Data Ingestion
```bash
pnpm ingest [--input-file path/to/ens_names.sql.gz] [--data-dir path/to/db]
```

`input-file`: Path to the gzipped [SQL dump file containing ENS rainbow tables](#getting-the-rainbow-tables) (default: './ens_names.sql.gz'). Only used during data ingestion.

`data-dir`: Directory for the LevelDB database. If not provided, defaults to `data/`

Ingests the rainbow table data into LevelDB. The process will exit with:
- Code 0: Successful ingestion
- Code 1: Error during ingestion

#### Database Validation
```bash
pnpm validate [--data-dir path/to/db]
```
Validates the database integrity by:
- Verifying the keys for all rainbow records are valid labelhashes
- Ensuring stored labels match their corresponding labelhashes
- Validating the total rainbow record count
- Verifying no ingestion was interrupted before successful completion

The process will exit with:
- Code 0: Validation successful
- Code 1: Validation failed or errors encountered

#### API Server
```bash
pnpm serve [--port 3223] [--data-dir path/to/db]
```
Starts the API server. The process will exit with:
- Code 0: Clean shutdown
- Code 1: Error during operation

### Common Options
All commands support these options:
- `--data-dir`: Directory for LevelDB data (default: './data')
- `--log-level`: Logging level: "debug", "info", "warn", "error" (default: "info")

### Database Management
If you need to start fresh with the database:
1. Stop any running ENSRainbow processes
2. Delete the LevelDB data directory (default: './data')
3. Run the ingest command again
