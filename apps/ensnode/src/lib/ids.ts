/**
 * Makes a cross-registrar unique registration ID.
 *
 * The ENS Subgraph has the potential to index "selected data" for any ENS name
 * (ex: through the Registry or the NameWrapper). However, the "selected data"
 * indexed by the ENS Subgraph varies depending on attributes of the name. For
 * example, the ENS Subgraph only indexes Registration records for direct
 * subnames of ".eth". This allows the ENS Subgraph to assign distinct
 * Registration ids using only the labelhash of the direct subname being
 * registered. (i.e. for the registration of "test.eth", the Registration's id
 * is `labelhash('test'))`.
 *
 * ENSNode (with multiple plugins activated) indexes Registration records from
 * multiple Registrars (like the base.eth and linea.eth Registrars). Therefore,
 * we use this function to avoid Registration id collisions that would otherwise
 * occur. (i.e. this function provides unique registration ids for "test.eth",
 * "test.base.eth", and "test.linea.eth", etc.
 *
 * @param registrarName the name of the registrar issuing the registration
 * @param labelHash the labelHash of the subname that was registered directly
 *                  beneath `registrarName`
 * @param node the node of the full name that was registered
 * @returns a unique registration id
