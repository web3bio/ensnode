The Docker images are the easiest way to run or deploy the ENSNode suite of services, both locally and in the cloud.

Below is a sample [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file linking the various services together.

<Code code={dockercompose} lang="yaml" title="docker-compose.yml" />

:::note[Port Mappings]
Note that while this example `docker-compose.yml` exposes each container's port to the host machine, you may only wish to expose ENSIndexer's `42069` (perhaps mapping it to ports `80/443`) and avoid exposing services like ENSRainbow, ENSAdmin, and your Postgres to the wider internet.
